abstract="Fine-grained image classification aims to classify hundreds of subcategories which belong to the same basic-level category. The confusion degrees among different subcategories are extremely different, and we should focus on learning the difference among the confusing subcategories. However, current methods treat all subcategories by equal cost, which causes the learned model good power for classifying subcategories that are not easy to confuse, but limited power for confusing ones. For addressing the above problem, we propose a cost-sensitive deep metric learning (CDML) approach, which integrates confusion driven deep metric learning and weighted softmax for learning the difference among the confusing subcategories. Confusion driven deep metric learning is proposed to focus on learning the difference among subcategories with small variance emphatically via triplet loss. The sampled ratio for triplets between two subcategories is adaptively and automatically set by confusing degrees, where the confusing subcategories are over-sampled for improving the ability to distinguish them. Weighted softmax is proposed to learn more discriminative features for easily mis-classification subcategories, which are assigned with high weights on them according to their mis-classification rates. Comparing with state-of-the-art methods on the CUB-200-2011 dataset, our CDML approach achieves the best classification accuracy.",
